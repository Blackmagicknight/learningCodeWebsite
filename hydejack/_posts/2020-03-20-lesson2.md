## basic python orpeations - Part 1
```py

>>> print('hello world')
hello world
>>> message = 'hello world'
>>> print(message)
hello world
>>> number = 5
>>> nuber2 = '5'
>>> number + nuber2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#5>", line 1, in <module>
    number + nuber2
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
>>> number + int(nuber2)

## First zoom lesson
today we practiced some python and later wrote notes. I learn creating variables and adding together, as well as changing a integer to string or the other way around. we then started working on some scratch to get a grip of things.


## Second zoom lesson
today we stated learning more basics of python in visual studio code. Later we started making a text based game related to the lord of the rings.

```py
import time
import sys

# print(only do yes and no in lower case for yes and no questions)

print("A very tall man is knocking at your door.")

time.sleep(2)

WizardName = input("Choose his name: ")
time.sleep(0.75)
print(WizardName + " is knocking at your door.")

time.sleep(2)

OpenDoor1 = input("do you want to open the door? ")

if OpenDoor1 == "yes":
    print(WizardName + "walks inside.")
else:
    print("Game Over!")
    time.sleep(2)
    exit()   

if OpenDoor1 == "no":
    print("Game Over!")
    time.sleep(2)
    exit()

time.sleep(2)

print("He sits on your couch.")


```


```py
number1 = 2
number2 = 3
total = number1 * number2
print(total)

total= number1 * number2 - number1
print(total)
